            <span>How long does it take to start receiving submissions?</span>
            <div>
              For Naming contests, you will start receiving your submissions
              within few minutes of launching your contest. Since our creatives
              are located across the globe, you can expect to receive
              submissions 24 X 7 throughout the duration of the brainstorming
              phase .

          <li>
            <span>How long do Naming Contests last?</span>
            <div>
              You can choose a duration from 1 day to 7 days. We recommend a
              duration of 3 Days or 5 Days. This allows for sufficient time for
              entry submission as well as brainstorming with creatives. If you
              take advantage of our validation services such as Audience Testing
              and Trademark Research, both will be an additional 4-7 days (3-5
              business days for Audience Testing and 1-2 business days for
              Trademark Research).

              other English speaking countries (i.e. United Kingdom, Canada, and
              Australia.). We utilize an advanced rating score algorithm to
              ensure that high quality creatives receive more opportunities to
              participate in our contests.

            <span>What if I do not like any submissions?</span>
            <div>
              While it is unusually rare that you will not like any names
              provided, we have a few options in case this problem occurs: If
              the contest ends and you have not yet found a name that you’d like
              to move forward with, we can provide complimentary extension of
              your contest as well as a complimentary consultation with one of

              domain marketplace you can apply the contest award towards the
              purchase of any name listed for sale. If you choose the Gold
              package or Platinum package and keep the contest as "Not
              Guaranteed", you can request a partial refund if you choose not to
              move forward with any name from you project. (Please note that the
